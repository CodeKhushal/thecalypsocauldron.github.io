<p style=font-size:30px;background-color:#fff9c7;>We are not just any virtual cafe, we are The Calypso Cauldron!</p>
<br>
<p style="font-size:20px">A rhythm sung around a dancing fire, a heavy aroma of flavour wafting in the air and people eagerly waiting to get a taste, that was the inspiration that we sought after.</p>
<br>
<p style="font-size:20px">Starting out as a group of 4, each one of us wanted to create something that resonated with us and our experiences. And coming together, we realised that the one thing we do desperately wanted was what was stripped off of us due to covid.
It started out as only a virtual cafe, where people could not only order food from, but also "meet" their friends via a virtual meet. We tried to create an ambience fit for doing activities together, and that led us to creating "The Pop and Bop" and "Twice Read Tales".</p>
<br>
<p style="font-size:20px"><u>And for us, that was the Calypso Cauldron.</u></p>
<br>
<p style=font-size:30px;background-color:white;> And for you, we hope that itâ€™s the one too. </p>
